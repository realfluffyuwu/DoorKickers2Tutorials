### Basic Weapon Tutorial

This is the Basic Weapon Tutorial Subfolder, this was used for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh-w9dqKB0E).

You can follow along by Downloading the Repository or just Starting from Scratch with the Same files inside the Starting Point.
This is by No means necessary to make a Mod, I just put the Starting point and Ending point so people can see the Difference and
be able to see all the files and the contents when ever they want.
